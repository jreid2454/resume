        <p class="about">
            My interest in technology started during my junior year of highschool, when I first took a class called Electrical Technology. It covered basic electrical circuits and electromagnetic properties. Although it is not the same field I ultimately decided to pursue, this was my first exposure to how amazing technology is, and my love for creating new and exciting things. There is nothing like the feeling after sinking in hours of work to see a project come to life, and from that point on I continued to look into new technological advances and the history of inventors. After highschool I wasn't exactly sure what field of engineering I wanted to do and i didnt want to waste time in college changing my degree plan multiple times if I wasn't sure yet. I decided that joining the military would be a great way to expose me to all sorts of different fields as well as giving me enough time to decide what was for me. On May 2, 2016 I reported to Great Lakes IL, for Navy bootcamp. I enlisted as a Communications Electronics Technician for submarines. After completing boot camp and the following year of schooling, I reported to a ship. Here I qualified for multiple watch stations that put me in the position to be responsible for millions of dollars worth of equipment. During this time I was thinking about which field of technology resonated with me the most. I thought of Electrical, Mechanical, and Robotics engineering, and although all are very important, I came to the conclusion that Software engineering was right for me. Since 2018 I have been studying programming utilizing multiple self teaching materials from books to online courses, and I am ready to join the workplace with knowledge and skills I have acquired.
